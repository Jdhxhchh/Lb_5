1. Understand the Requirements:
   - Clearly understand the requirements of the task, which involve creating a simplified banking system with account operations and exception handling.

2. Create Exception Classes:
   - Identify the types of exceptions that may occur in the system and create corresponding exception classes (`InsufficientFundsException`, `NegativeAmountException`, `AccountNotFoundException`).

3. Design the `BankAccount` Class:
   - Define the attributes (`accountNumber`, `accountName`, `balance`) and methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, `getAccountSummary`) for the `BankAccount` class.

4. Implement Exception Handling in `BankAccount`:
   - Add appropriate exception handling in the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods of the `BankAccount` class.

5. Create the `Bank` Class:
   - Define the `Bank` class with methods for creating accounts (`createAccount`), finding accounts (`findAccount`), and transferring money (`transferMoney`).

6. Implement Exception Handling in `Bank`:
   - Add exception handling in the `findAccount` and `transferMoney` methods of the `Bank` class.
   - 
7. Write the `Main` Class for Testing:
   - Develop a `Main` class with the `main` method to test the functionality of the banking system.
   - In the `main` method, create a `Bank` object, create accounts, perform transactions, and handle exceptions.

8. Test the Code:
   - Run the program and test various scenarios to ensure that exception handling works correctly.

9. Refine and Improve:
   - Review the code for clarity, correctness, and efficiency.
   - Consider refactoring or optimizing the code if needed.

10. Documentation:
    - Add comments to the code for better understanding.
    - Document any assumptions, constraints, or important considerations.

11. Version Control (Optional):
    - If using version control (e.g., Git), commit the code with descriptive commit messages.
